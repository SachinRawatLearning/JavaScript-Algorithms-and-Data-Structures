JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

Problem Solving Patterns:

1.Frequency Counter Pattern:

This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with arrays / strings

2.Multiple Pointers:

Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition
Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well
